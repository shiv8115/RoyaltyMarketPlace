In this project we will develop smart-contracts for an NFT Marketplace that has the following features:

1- Seller can list NFTs for sale at their desired price

2- Buyer can buy the NFT at sellerâ€™s price

3- Buyer can make an offer for the listed NFTs with alternate price

4- Seller can accept or reject that offer

5- A Platform fee is charged from the payment

6- The owner of the Marketplace can add or remove the ERC20 tokens used as the mode of payment

7- The Producer of the NFT gets a royalty with each exchange of hands according to ERC-2981 Royalty Standard
